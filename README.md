### What I learned

 ---I learned various CSS styling techniques to create visually appealing components, including box model properties, flexbox layout, and border-radius for rounded corners.
 --- I discovered how to integrate external fonts into my project using Google Fonts, allowing for greater flexibility in typography choices.
 --- I practiced creating responsive designs by using percentage-based widths, fluid images, and media queries to ensure that the component looks great on devices of all sizes.

--- I explored color management in CSS by using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values to define colors, which provided more control and flexibility over the color palette of the project.
--- I learned how to create a README file to document my project, including sections such as project overview, features, technologies used, and credits.
